##This is a simple application to help you understand modules better!


**Start at this file:**
simple_solution_without_node_modules.js

Simple Solution will outline exactly what the quadratic equation is, what variables are needed, and show you where the output comes from. This was the starting point for this application. From here, the application was split into three modules.


**The three modules are:**
discriminant.js
quadratic.js
solve.js


**_Run solve.js to see the program in action._** 
You will be prompted for input, and the roots will be returned to you (assuming no errors)
